# About Me
Hi o/

I'm Paulo Feodrippe, a software engineer contractor based on SP - Brazil. I'm interested in distributed systems, development tooling and my wife (besides my little dog called Pitoco). 

I've been developing systems since 2015, and working with everyone's favorite language[^clojure] since 2017.

[^clojure]: Clojure, of course ðŸ˜¬
