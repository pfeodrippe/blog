# Pitoco

One project I have been working recently is [Pitoco](https://github.com/pfeodrippe/pitoco), itâ€™s written in Clojure and was originally created with the purpose of inferring REST HTTP requests using packet capture, heavily inspired in a startup called [Akita](https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog).
